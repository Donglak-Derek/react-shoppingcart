## reactjs

- react basic tutorial

## memo

- keyboart short cut: imrc(import react component ) & cc (componet class)
- React.Fragment
- state : any data this component needs
- method : jsx is just normal javascript
- set attributes - adding pic
- className in jsx
- bootstrap "npm i bootstrap@..." and add in index.js 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
- style attribute
- jsx not have loop function
- trusy or falsy
- event handler without ()
- bind method to use "this" - constructor
- increase attribute with "setState" - difference with angular
- passing the event argument : NOT WORK!! CHECK THIS OUT!!

- so far, JSX, Rendering List, Conditional Rendering, Handling Events, Updating the State

- From here, Pass Data, Raise and Handle Events, Multiple Components in Sync, Functional Components, Lifcycle Hooks

- difference between props and state :

  - props includes data that we give to a component whereas state include data that is local or private to that component so other components cannot access that state it's completely internal to that component.

- The component that owns a piece of the state, should be the one modifying it.
- single source of truth

  - controlled component : component doesn't have own state

- sync data : to use data from Counter on NavBar - Lifting State Up
